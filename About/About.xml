	<description>"no power comms console"
	
	"well technicly you are using animals to power your stuff"
		
	- adds 1 message table (comms console)
	- adds 1 bird cage (needs food to feed him, powers comms console literaly)
	- adds 2 type of trade markers (orbital trade beacons, one fueled, one not)
	- adds 1 research project (all buildings in this mod needs this as prerequisite)
	- adds 1 ressource (glow crystal), can be bought from exotic goods traders (or traders dealing with such wares)
	- adds 1 recipe to stonecutters table to craft glow crystals (req lv10 crafting) (more a alternate way to get them if u have bad luck on traders)
	
	There are several different textures for the trademarkers and bird cage. you can switch between them by rotating your buildling.
	
	(To be correct the message table needs 1 power and the bird cage produces one. It's a bit of a workaround. you can totaly abuse this i know, as always it's your game, so do to your liking. i just wanted a comms console, which fits with low tech/no gun runs)
